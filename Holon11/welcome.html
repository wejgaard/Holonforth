<h4>Installation </h4>

  <p>Store the files in one common directory.&nbsp;</p>

  <h4>Files</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>HOLON11.EXE&nbsp; is the development environment (the host). </li>
    <li>HOLON11.STR and HOLON11.TEX contain the source text of the target program. </li>
    <li>HOLON11.COD&nbsp;contains a code image of the target program. </li>
    <li>HOLONHLP.STR&nbsp;and HOLONHLP.TEX contain the online manual. </li>
    <li>BOOTLOAD.COD&nbsp;is bootloaded into the 68HC11
      in its special bootstrap mode&nbsp;<br>
 (initially this file is a copy of IMON.IMG)&nbsp; </li>
    <li>IMON.IMG&nbsp; --&nbsp; Monitor, operates in the internal RAM of the 68HC11 </li>
    <li>PMON.IMG&nbsp; --&nbsp; Monitor, operates in the external program RAM at $FF00 ff</li>
    <li>NOEEPROM.IMG&nbsp; --&nbsp; Sets CONFIG=$0C and thus disables the internal EEPROM.</li>
  </ul>

<h4>Start Holon</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Holon runs under DOS. When HOLON11 starts, the system looks for the files HOLON11.STR
  and HOLON11.TEX in the<em> </em>working directory. HOLON11 shows the welcome screen.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>If you see an empty browser and the question: &quot;Create a new application?
    Y/N&quot;, then HOLON11 has not found the program files .STR and .TEX, probably because
    the working directory is not set to the Holon directory. Press N and restart Holon in a
    different way.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h4>Get acquainted with the browser</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>You see the source text of the target program in a browser, clearly structured into
  modules, groups, and Forth words. In the central part you see the definition of the
  current word and a comment in a separate pane. The stack pane at the bottom is used for interactive testing. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the cursor keys to move around in the browser. </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Below the stack pane a&nbsp;function key menu is shown. <ul>
    <li>Press the <em>Ctrl</em> key to see other commands, e.g. Ctrl+F4=Test (opens
      a window for the classical Forth command line interpreter).</li>
    <li>More functions are available with&nbsp;the <em>Alt</em> key and the <em>Ctrl+Sft</em>
      key combination. </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h4>Contact&nbsp; the Target</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Holon 11 is an &quot;umbilical&quot; development system. The host is meant to be in
  contact (online) with a running target system. The umbilical method considerably speeds up
  development. It provides instant response to all your actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The host controls the target via a tiny monitor, which occupies 200 bytes in the
  target memory space. No emulator or other development hardware is needed. &nbsp; </p>

<h5>Target Requirements:</h5>

  <p>Holon 11 works with any&nbsp; 68HC11 board that has:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>8 MHz crystal = 2 MHz system clock. (Other clock rates are possible, see <a href="#baud">remarks</a>.)</li>
    <li>Communication with RS232 conversion on the SCI port.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>The ability to change between the &quot;normal expanded&quot; and &quot;special
      bootstrap&quot; mode.&nbsp; </li>
    <li> The TxD output of the 68HC11 (pin PD1) must be
      terminated with a 10 kOhm resistor to VDD.&nbsp;<br>
      (The internal bootroutine in the 68HC11 sets the
      TxD line to open drain.) </li>
  </ul>

<h5><strong>Send the monitor to the target</strong>:</h5>

  <ul>
    <li>Connect the SCI port to a COM port on the host. </li>
    <li>If you are not using COM1, change the COM port in the system setup: Press Ctrl+Sft+F3,
      and then press the space bar until the correct COM port number shows. Exit with &lt;Esc&gt;.</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p><img src="welcome.gif" alt="System setup" width="492" height="231"></p>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Set the 68HC11 into &quot;special bootstrap&quot; mode.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Press Ctrl+Sft+F6=Bootload to start the bootload sequence. The host now waits for the
      target.</li>
    <li>Press the reset button on the target (or generate a reset otherwise). The target
      sends a RS232 break signal to the host. </li>
    <li>When the host receives the break signal, it downloads the contents of the file
      BOOTLOAD.COD,&nbsp; and displays the progress of the transmission. </li>
    <li>The file BOOTLOAD.COD initially contains the monitor <b>IMON</b>, which installs itself and starts
      communication. You should see the blinking dot at the lower right corner now.&nbsp; </li>
  </ul>

<h5><strong>Remarks</strong>:</h5>

  <ul>
    <li>You find initial information about the monitors in the online manual
      (press F1). For detailed information about all available monitors see the application note <a href="http://holonforth.com/tools/notes/an11-2.htm">Holon
      11 monitors</a>. </li>
    <li>Holon 11 is set up for 9600 baud communication during development and 1200 baud for
      bootloading, which corresponds to a 2 MHz system clock in the 68HC11. </li>
    <li><a name="baud"></a><em>Other baud rates and system clocks are possible</em>. You can set
      the baud rate of Holon 11 to any value that is supported by the PC's COM port. However, if
      you choose a different 68HC11 system clock, the baud rate division factor in the target
      monitor will probably need to be changed. Licensed users of Holon 11 receive the source
      code of the monitors and can adapt a monitor to special cases. </li>
    <li>Although the SCI port is used for communication with the monitor, you
      can still use it for the application program, as demonstrated in the tutorial Using
      Holon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h4>First steps in the target</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>Now that host and target communicate, load code into the target and have
some fun.</p>

<h5>Setup ROM and RAM space according to your target board </h5>
  <p>The first words in the browser set up the memory spaces: SetROM and
  SetRAM in system module Basis. Adapt the values to the memory spaces of
  your target board:&nbsp; </p>
  <p> Press Ctrl+Home to move to the start of the program. Go to
  the word SetROM, if you are not already there, and press F2=Edit. Change the
  memory values in SetROM. Press Ctrl+PgDn and change the memory values in
  SetRAM. Press &lt;Esc&gt; to exit the Text window.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

  <h5>Load the program</h5>

  <p>Press Ctrl+F2=InitCode, then press Ctrl+F3=LoadAll. Holon11 clears the code
  space and sets up the internal pointers, then it loads the program
  sequentially starting with the first word in the browser. Watch the progress
  in the browser: Holon11 marks the currently loaded group.&nbsp;</p>

  <h5>Test a word</h5>

<p>Test the simple word <b>dup</b>.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font
face="arial, helvetia" size="2">-- <i>If <b>dup</b>  works, the whole system
works. --&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></font> <font
face="arial, helvetia" size="2">Use the direct access method to go to <b>dup</b>:
  press the space bar and type&nbsp; d u p . This brings you to the word.</p>

<p>You need a number on the stack as an argument for <b>dup</b>. Type a number, say: 77. The first digit opens
  the stack entry field. Press &lt;Enter&gt; to finish the entry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now execute <b>dup</b>: Press F4=Run. If all is well, you see your number
  duplicated on the stack. -- The number was sent to the target, the word was
  executed, and the target stack was again sent to the
  host.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Testing a simple word builds confidence. You see immediately in the stack
window, whether the word - and the system - works. The stack shows the
result.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If there is a problem, you might like to look into the code and watch its action step by
step? Let's do it.</p>

  <h5>Step through <i>dup</i></h5>

<p>Press Alt+F4=Debug. Holon11 shows the
  current values of the CPU registers and marks the first step in the
  definition. If the stack window has base=10 (decimal), press Alt+B and change to&nbsp;
hexadecimal.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Press F4 to execute the first step. Check the X register and see the action
  of PULX, the first instruction in <b>dup</b>. Press F4 again and watch the stack.
  Continue until the end.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note that you stay in the comfort of the browser even while debugging. I like
immediate access to my application program in all details, and that's what Holon
provides me.&nbsp;</p>

  <h5>Have a look at the code</h5>

<p>If the debugger points out a problem, a look at the generated binary code in
memory might help.</p>

  <p>Press F6=Code and look into the program code. If the code window is marked
  &quot;DATA&quot;, press F6 once more for &quot;PROG&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>If the code lines start with F, you are watching the memory
  image in the <i> code file</i>. Press T to see the code in the target memory. If the memory content is
  displayed normally (white on blue), the code in the target is equal to the
  code in the file. Code that is marked (yellow on magenta) differs between file and target.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Check the code of <b>dup</b>. The code is framed in yellow brackets {}.
You should recognize the opcodes in the definition of <b>dup</b>.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><i>If the code in the target is incorrect, try and load the program
    again. If </i><i>all code is wrong, there is a memory addressing problem. This can happen with the
    68HC11F1, if your board uses unconventional chip selects. See the
    application note <a href="http://holonforth.com/tools/notes/an11-2.htm">Holon
      11 monitors</a>.&nbsp;</i></p>

  </blockquote>

<h5>Test a high-level word</h5>

<p>Go to the word<b> m*</b>&nbsp; ('m-star') and read about its function. Enter two numbers on
the stack and execute the word.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The result is a 32 bit double number. The stack window displays the double number as
separate high and low 16 bit values.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Have a good look at the definition of <b>m*</b>: Enter the editor (press F2
or &lt;Enter&gt;), put the cursor
on &quot;2dup&quot; and press F7=GoLook. Holon takes you to the definition of <b>2dup</b>.
Go back with F8 and look up other words in the definition. In this particular
case all words in <b> m*</b> are code words, however, the words in the definition can be
any type. You see here the principle of Forth: All existing words can be used to
create new &quot;high-level&quot; words.&nbsp;I call them <i>colon</i> words,
since high-level Forth words are defined with an initial ':' .</p>

<h5>Step trough <i>m*</i></h5>

<p>Let's have a very close look at the action of <b>m*</b> and explore the
debugger a little more..</p>

<p> From the
previous test there should still be two numbers on the stack, otherwise please
supply two nice values for the test. Press Alt+F4=Debug and check the stack window.
Since you are now testing a colon word, the CPU registers are
replaced by the contents of the return stack, which is of more interest here.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>The word is called by the Forth machine (the &quot;inner
  interpreter&quot;). The Forth machine first stores the current instruction pointer
  on the return stack, and then passes control to the colon word. The final <b>;</b>
  (semicolon) in the word retrieves the instruction pointer from the
  return stack and returns control.&nbsp;</i></p>

</blockquote>
<p>See the instruction pointer of the calling word on the return stack. Step and observe the action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Step to the word <b>swap</b>, press F3=GoSub and have a look at the
definition of <b>swap</b>. The browser jumps to the word <b>swap</b> and
lets you continue execution through its code. The CPU registers are displayed,
because <b>swap</b> is a code word.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Step to the end of <b>swap</b> and see Holon return to the calling word <b>m*</b>.
Press F6=run and let the execution continue until the end of the word.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can follow the execution of the program step-by-step through all
subwords, even down through the Forth machine, the word <b>next</b>. Holon gives
you control of every detail of your programs. You can understand every byte in
the target, and remember: <i>A fully understood program has no bugs!</i></p>

<p>If everything worked as intended, you should
now have a good feeling for the browser and for the ways that you can handle and test
your program. There are a couple more features to explore. The online manual
(F1=Help) has all the information.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>

<h4>See some action on your board</h4>

</font>

<blockquote>

<font
face="arial, helvetia" size="2"><p>How about a little action in the target? Let's assume that you have a
<i> LED connected to
pin PA6 (portA, bit 6).&nbsp;</i></p>

<p> Now write a program to have the LED emit the morse signal
&quot;SOS&quot;. You need words to turn the LED on, to turn the LED off, and to
delay the execution.</p>

<h5>Create a module for the test program</h5>

<p>Go the last module, press Alt+F2=New, type the name of the module, say:
&quot;Testing&quot;, press &lt;Enter&gt;.</p>

<h5>Create a group for the LED words</h5>

<p>Go to the empty group window. Press F2=New, enter the name of the group, say:
&quot;LED driver&quot;.</p>

<h5>Create a group for the action</h5>

<p>Press Alt+F2=New, enter &quot;The Action&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

<h5>Write the LED driver</h5>

<p>Go back to the group <i>LED driver,</i> then go to the Word window. Press
F2=New and define the word, which turns the LED on. You only want to change bit
6.</p>

<p>: LED-on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PORTA&nbsp; c@&nbsp; $40&nbsp;
or&nbsp; PORTA c!&nbsp;&nbsp; ;</p>

<p>Press F3=Load to exit the editor and load the word in one step. Then press
F4=Run to test the word. The LED should light. There is not much that can go
wrong. See the action of your word step by step in the debugger. Note what is
written into PORTA. Check the hardware on your board.</p>

<p>Now create a word that turns the LED off. Define and test:</p>

<p>: LED-off&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PORTA&nbsp; c@&nbsp; $BF
and&nbsp;&nbsp; PORTA c!&nbsp;&nbsp; ;</p>

<p>This ends the &quot;LED driver&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>Note: Although it is very simple, the example shows the essence of writing
  drivers for hardware in Forth. You build words that &quot;move&quot; the
  hardware, and test the words immediately. This hands-on action keeps you in the
  real world. You immediately learn if you know the
  hardware well enough.&nbsp;</i></p>

</blockquote>
<h5>Write the action</h5>

<p>Go to the group <i> The Action</i> and create the action words.</p>

<p>We create the delay with a simple loop:</p>

<p>: delay&nbsp;&nbsp; ( n -- )&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 do loop&nbsp; ;</p>

<p>: pulse&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; LED-on&nbsp; delay&nbsp; LED-off&nbsp; ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \ Loops n times</p>

<p>: short&nbsp;&nbsp; 5000 pulse&nbsp; ;</p>

<p>: long&nbsp;&nbsp; 15000 pulse&nbsp; ;</p>

<p>: pause&nbsp; 5000 0 do loop&nbsp; ;</p>

</font>
<p><font
face="arial, helvetia" size="2">Test the words. </font><font
face="arial, helvetia" size="2">If ok, define the morse signals &quot;S&quot; and
&quot;O&quot;.</p>

<p>: S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; short pause short pause short pause&nbsp; ;</p>

<p>: O&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long pause long pause long pause&nbsp; ;</p>

<p>And create the final word, your application.</p>

<p>: SOS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S O S&nbsp; ;</p>

  <h5>Note</h5>

  <p>The LED driver is written in high-level Forth words, because this is
  the simple way most of the time. If execution speed is important, substitute the words with assembler code.
  Replace the previous definitions
  by:</p>

  <p>Code LED-on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LDX # PORTA&nbsp;&nbsp; BSET 0 ,x
  $40&nbsp;&nbsp; NEXT<br>
  Code LED-off&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LDX # PORTA&nbsp;&nbsp; BCLR 0 ,x
  $40&nbsp;&nbsp; NEXT</p>

  <p>When you load the new words, Holon creates new code and exchanges the
  code in the target memory. The old code is replaced, and the new code is
  immediately active. <i> You don't have to reload all the application words,</i> the
  application words use the new code already. -- Try it. Look up the memory and
  check the code.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
